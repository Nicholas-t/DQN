# DQN on the CartPole gym environment

This repository contains an implementation of Deep Q Network using PyTorch specifically to solve the CartPole environment.

## Environment and dependencies

- OS : Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS
- Python 3.7 (Tensorflow 1.15 works at this version)
- PIP

if you have python version above 3.7, then refer to [this](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/how-to-install-python-3-ubuntu) tutorial on how you can install a specific python version in your ubuntu machine


## How to install ?

You can clone the repository and install the necesarry dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/Nicholas-t/DQN
cd DQN
python3.7 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to run ?

If you have jupyter notebook, you can simply run the cells that included the code.
