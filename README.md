## Introduction

Deep reinforcement learning has been a prevelant topic among Researchers and Professionals, it event reaches the mainstream's radar (for the more tech-savy ones) when in 2015, [https://www.deepmind.com/](DeepMind) reaches a milestone for the topic by creating [https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago](AlphaGo) and challenges the world's best human Go player from Korea, Lee Sedol, noting that the game Go was supposed to be more complex than the game chess and WON. It was an amazing feat to showcase what the future of the space may hold.

## Structure

In this repository we will firstly explore Reinforcement learning and the basic notion of relationships between an agent and their environment, then, we will explore some topic in deep learning that is particularly relevant for the final topic which is where we combine the two sections and discuss Deep Reinforcement learning.
